## Overview

Development of a QR-based restaurant menu and ordering system using React for front-end, Tailwind CSS for styling, and seamless integration with backend services for real-time updates and order management.


## Key Features

- QR Code Menu Access: Customers can scan a unique QR code to instantly view the restaurant’s menu on their device—no app download required.
- Real-time Order Management: Restaurants can manage orders as they come in, with live status updates and notifications.
- Customizable Menu Interface: Allows restaurants to showcase their branding through customizable colors, images, and menu layouts.
- Portion & Pricing Control: Flexible tools for managing portions, sizes, and pricing structures.
- Table Identification: Supports smart table mapping and location-based order identification.
- Performance Dashboard: Provides restaurants with insights into order history, peak hours, and sales analytics.
- Admin Access Control: Enables restaurants to define roles and permissions for team members.


## Technologies Used

- React & Next.js: For a fast, modular, and SEO-friendly frontend experience.
- Tailwind CSS: For responsive, utility-first UI styling.
- Node.js & Express: Backend architecture for API handling and server operations.
- MongoDB: To store menu data, orders, and restaurant profiles securely.
- Figma: For UI/UX design and collaboration.
- Cloudinary: For managing image uploads and optimization.


## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was designing a system flexible enough to accommodate diverse restaurant needs without compromising on usability. We tackled this with a component-based architecture and centralized state management. Coordinating real-time updates for orders and table identification also required a reliable system of event handling and database syncing. The process taught us the value of balancing customization with user simplicity, and the importance of syncing design and dev workflows using Figma and Git.

## Outcome

DineQR has enabled restaurants to digitize their ordering process with minimal setup. It reduced manual errors, increased table turnover rates, and enhanced the overall customer experience. The platform is now being adopted by restaurants of varying sizes, laying the groundwork for scalable growth and more intelligent dining solutions.
